# Checkpoint 1 grade

# Checkpoint 2 grade

__Total__ (30 / 30)

__Words__ (6 / 6) The text is laid out cleanly, with clear divisions
and transitions between sections and sub-sections. The writing itself
is well-organized, free of grammatical and other mechanical errors,
divided into complete sentences logically grouped into paragraphs and
sections, and easy to follow from the presumed level of knowledge. 

__Numbers__ (1 / 1) All numerical results or summaries are reported to
suitable precision, and with appropriate measures of uncertainty
attached when applicable. 

__Pictures__ (7 / 7) Figures and tables are easy to read, with
informative captions, axis labels and legends, and are placed near the
relevant pieces of text or referred to with convenient labels. 

__Code__ (4 / 4) The code is formatted and organized so that it is easy
for others to read and understand. It is indented, commented, and uses
meaningful names. It only includes computations which are actually
needed to answer the analytical questions, and avoids redundancy. Code
borrowed from the notes, from books, or from resources found online is
explicitly acknowledged and sourced in the comments. Functions or
procedures not directly taken from the notes have accompanying tests
which check whether the code does what it is supposed to. The text of
the report is free of intrusive blocks of code. With regards to R Markdown,
all calculations are actually done in the file as it knits, and only
relevant results are shown.

__Exploratory data analysis__ (12 / 12) Variables are examined individually and
bivariately. Features/observations are discussed with appropriate
figure or tables. The relevance of the EDA to the questions and
potential models is clearly explained.

__Words__ (8 / 8) The text is laid out cleanly, with clear divisions and
transitions between sections and sub-sections.  The writing itself is
well-organized, free of grammatical and other mechanical errors, divided into
complete sentences logically grouped into paragraphs and sections, and easy to
follow from the presumed level of knowledge.

__Exploratory Data Analysis__ (12 / 12) Variables are examined individually and
bivariately. Features/observations are discussed with appropriate
figure or tables. The relevance of the EDA to the questions and
potential models is clearly explained.

__Results and analysis__ (25 / 25) The statistical summaries
are clearly related to, or possibly derive from, the substantive questions of interest.  Any
assumptions are checked by means of appropriate diagnostic plots or
formal tests. Limitations from un-fixable problems are
clearly noted. The actual estimation
of parameters, predictions, or other calculations are technically correct.  All calculations
based on estimates are clearly explained, and also technically correct.  All
estimates or derived quantities are accompanied with appropriate measures of
uncertainty. 

__Conclusions__ (8 / 8) The substantive questions are answered as
precisely as the data and the model allow.  The chain of reasoning from
estimation results about models, or derived quantities, to substantive
conclusions is both clear and convincing.  Contingent answers ("if $X$, then
$Y$, but if $Z$, then $W$") are likewise described as warranted by the
and data.  If uncertainties in the data mean the answers to some
questions must be imprecise, this too is reflected in the conclusions.
